"""Drop MPEG-TS null packets (PID 0x1FFF) from an engine source.

An engine can keep a dead source "alive" with padding alone: on a small ARM
box a source that had no picture delivered 9.4 MB, every byte of it null
packets. The relay took that for media, so the first byte arrived at once,
the stall timer never ran, the waiting card came late and no other source
was tried; the viewer waited for nothing until Kodi gave up.

Null packets carry nothing a player needs (they only pad a constant bitrate),
so the relay leaves them out: a source that sends only padding looks silent
and fails its start or stall deadline like any other silent source.

Fail-open: when the chunks are not aligned 188-byte packets, the rest of the
source passes through unchanged, once logged.
