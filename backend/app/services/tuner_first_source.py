"""«Starts with»: the next opening of a TV channel from one device begins with
the source a person chose (acestream-tvbox #12, #20).

The Kodi skin asks for it with a short request and then opens the channel
through the PVR as always, so ↑ ↓ and the channel's info keep working.

- **Per device and channel.** The device is the client address the fork sees
  (the route's peer, after the trusted forwarded headers). Clients that reach the fork through the Docker
  gateway all show the gateway's address, so they share one choice.
- **Lasts CHOICE_SECONDS** from when it was made, and **only that opening.**
  Kodi opens a channel with a HEAD and two GETs, closing the first GET early
  (sometimes after the second has started): all of them must start with the
  chosen source. So the choice is not used up by a GET but by the end of the
  opening: when a GET that started with it ends -- played, closed or
  cancelled by Kodi -- GETs arriving within SAME_OPENING_SECONDS still start
  with it (Kodi's second GET), and once one of those ends too it is spent.
- **If the chosen source fails** the relay goes on in the automatic order
  and never comes back to it: its refreshed candidates leave it out, and the
  choice is spent at once, so the next GET does not start with it either.
  That does not depend on the relay's failure memory (FAILURE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS).
- **A source the relay saw fail a moment ago** (failed_recently) is not put
  first: the choice is ignored for that GET.

Process memory only; nothing is written to the DB.
